# Counter-Strike-GO-CFGs
My csgo configs files (CFG)
Featuring:
- Personal configs
- Server configs
- Organized code
- Full of useful binds
- JumpThrow script (in personal only, duh)

The use is very simple, download the CFG and use notepad to change to your preferences (like sensity).
Basically all CFG is commented, but someones is in portuguese (sorry =/)
